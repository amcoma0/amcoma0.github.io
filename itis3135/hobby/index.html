                    Now you may have come into this website thinking one of two things, golf is so boring or golf is great.
                    This website has been created to help you start the attitude change towards the latter. Golf has been
                    one of my favorite sports for a long time, whether it is playing it or watching it on TV.

                    Golf is very deceptive in how it presents itself to others that are not familiar with how the game works and what it takes to play well.
                    Many people, maybe including yourself will either watch Golf or hear about it and think to themselves, "How could anyone think this sport is interesting?".
                    Well I would say that once you can learn the sport and understand what it takes to be a good player, you start to appreciate
                    the sport for what it is. A game that takes a lot of strategy and a great mental capacity to perform up to the level of the best.
                    It also takes an insane amount of effort and time to even try to become a professional because of the level that professionals play at.

                    Using this website, you will learn about how the scoring in golf works, the history of the game and the impact that it has had, and the 
                    players in the game that have made it as interesting and as great as it is today.

                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <p>
                    The first thing we are going to look at is how the scoring works. Many people know that the lower the score the better. But they probably do not 
                    understand exactly how scoring actually works during a round. This is an important concept because it allows people to actually understand what people are talking about 
                    when they mention how bad or good they "shot" in a round. Which "shot" in this context means the final score that said person had.
                    We are going to look at a scorecard to help us examine how this works.
                </p>
                <fig>
                    <img src = "images/GolfScorecard.jpg" alt = "Golf Scorecard">
                    <figcaption><i>Golf Scorecard</i></figcaption>
                </fig>
                <p>
                    As you can see on this scorecard there are many labels and rows and columns and it can be very confusing while looking at it for
                    the first time. The top row is going to show the hole number, the second row through the fourth row shows the different yardages 
                    according to which tees you play from. From the second row down it goes from harder to easier because the holes get shorter.
                    The fifth row is going to show the handicap of each hole. This is one of the more confusing ones here but fairly simple to explain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The handicap of a hole pretty much describes how difficult the hole is. So a 1 handicap hole is going to be the hardest hole on the course, while the 18th 
                    handicapped hole is going to be the easiest hole on the course. Continuing down, the next four rows are going to be for players to keep track of their
                    scores on each hole so that way adding them up at the end will be easier. The 10th row is telling the player what the par is for each hole. We will get
                    more into that later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we will talk about how scoring actually works. On each hole there is a par, which informs the player how many shots they are expected to get
                    the ball into the hole. When someone gets the ball into the hole in exactly the same amount of shots, that player records a par on their scorecard.
                    Now there are obviously many other possibilities that can happen on a golf course which will be described in the table below.

                    Once you reach the end of your round, if you keep track correctly, you will have to add up all of your scores from each hole 
                    to get your final score.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The history of golf is surprisingly pretty interesting and has a lot of background that many people do not know about, even
                    those that do play golf on a regular basis. To help us get an understanding of how deep golf history is we are gonna start 
                    at the very beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Golf started in the mid 1400's close to Edinburgh, Scotland. Like many sports, the game it evolved from looked pretty different
                    to what we see nowadays. The game of golf back then had different rules that would take too long to get into but the game has evolved
                    so much. One of the great testaments to the history of golf is St. Andrews, The Old Course. This course is the first golf course created
                    and is cherished by golfers all around the world for it natural beauty but also challenging design. Golf has become a game that is through
                    lots of trial and error like many other games have. 
                </p>

                </fig>
                <p>
                    One of the things that have changed the most is the equipment itself that players use. Now some people unfamiliar with the game
                    might think that the equipmemt shouldn't have that big of an effect since it is just a golf ball and some golf clubs, but 
                    they would be mistaken as it has had a huge effect on how the game is played. There are many different types of golf balls that 
                    provide multiple advantages and disadvantages depending on how you individually play. There also even more variations of golf clubs
                    that have continued to evolve, almost every year. The clubs that we have nowadays have been specifically designed to give players
                    more forgiveness and distance than the old clubs that players used to have to play with. This has led to a jump in distance like we have
                    never seen in professional golf over the last decade or so. This jump in distance has led the PGA to consider "rolling back" the golf
                    ball to make it produce less distance so that golfers can be "challenged" more. However this consideration has been met with a lot of criticism
                    from not only players but fans alike because they recognize that more distance makes the game that much more interesting to watch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the game of golf is in a great spot right now and will continue to grow and expand to many others that may not be able to watch or
                    play as of now. Golf is a fun, relaxing way to spend quality time outside with some of your friends but it also is very 
                    challenging if you let it be.

                <h2>Players</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many players that have left their mark on the game because they overcame a lot of the most challenging parts of the game
                    Such names as Tiger Woods, Jack Nicholas, Arnold Palmer, and so many more. I want to talk about two of my favorite golfers that 
                    have influenced my golf game the most. These two players are Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are going to start by talking about Rory McIlroy. Rory McIlroy is known right now for being one of the best drivers of 
                    the golf ball in the history of the PGA Tour (PGA Tour is similar to the NBA, NFl, etc. for golf). He turned pro in 2007 as a 17 year old 
                    and quickly started to find success. He would start by playing on the European Tour and slowly working himself into playing some PGA events.
                    In 2011 he would win his first major of his career at the U.S. Open and he would win 3 more from then to 2014, becoming one of 3 players to 
                    win 4 majors before the age of 25. His career projection at that point was to be up there at the top with Tiger but he has not won another 
                    major since. Ever since then people have been doubting if Rory can ever win another major. The thing I love about Rory is his dominant driving
                    and when he does win he has tons of energy. We have yet to see if he will win another major and we will have to wait and see this year if he can
                    get the job done.  
                </p>

                </fig>
                <p>
                    The other player we will talk about is Tiger Woods, aka the Goat. Many people nowadays know him for his escapades outside of golf.
                    We are not hear to talk about that though, we are going to purely focus on his golf game and how dominant he was during his time on
                    Tour. He is known to many golfers as the Greatest Player of All Time, and is one of the best iron players in the history of the game.
                    One of the most utilized parts of his game didn't really have much to do with his physical skill, but with his mindset and his
                    clutch ability. He would be able to take over a round in a matter of minutes by just being intimidating on the course and by purely imposing
                    his will on the golf course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some crazy stats that prove how dominant Tiger Woods was in his prime:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tiger's record when holding the outright lead after 54 holes and entering the last round of the tournament is a ridiculous 41-2</li>
                    <li>When Tiger Woods teed it up at a tournament he has a 27.3 percent winning rate. This is absolutely unheard of and mind-blowing</li>
                    <li>At the U.S. Open in 2000 (which is one of the hardest events in golf) Tiger won by an astounding 15 shots, which is a record that
                        will stand for a long time. Considering it was at Pebble Beach as well makes this an even bigger accomplishment
                    </li>
