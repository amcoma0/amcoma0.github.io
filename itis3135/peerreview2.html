            <ul>
                <li>There is one uppercase folder name titled "Scripts" that the page links to</li>
                <li>Design</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Page is very easy to read and has good contrast and font sizing</li>
                    <li>There is a separate css folder that she has a default stylesheet for</li>
                    <li>CRAP</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast: There is a very good color contrast on this page and all of the different elements stick 
                            out as separate due to the color scheme
                        </li>
                        <li>Repitition: There is good reptition for this site as each page feels like it is 
                            all part of the same site and most of the elements are kept from page to page
                        </li>
                        <li>Alignment: The alignment could be a little better on mostly the About Me page because 
                            the body text just doesn't feel right sitting where it is
                        </li>
                        <li>Proximity: The proximity of this site overall is pretty good</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>Page has header, main, footer, and a nav bar at the top of the body</li>
                <li>The header does not have the site/brand header with text as an h1</li>
                <li>The home page of this site has the name of the client as an h1, not an h2 at the start of main</li>
                <li>Page does not have a brand tagline anywhere as this is a client project</li>
                <li>Page does not have a footer with any nav bar or any validation buttons for html or css</li>
            </ul>
