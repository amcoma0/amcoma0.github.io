                    <li>Application and Purpose: </li>
                    <p>This application is a site about the programming language Java. The purpose of this site
                        is to teach students abotu the basics of programming through the language of Java.
                    </p>
                    <li>Intended Users: </li>
                    <p>The intended users for this applicayion will be students.</p>
                    <li>Overview of Content: </li>
                    <p>The site will cover multiple topics such as Functions, Variables, Conditionals, 
                        and a few others. This site will mostly be used to discuss just the basics of 
                        all of these concepts and get someone interested into programming.

            <p>I plan to use some JavaScript for most of the pages within the website. As this is 
                a website designed to help students learn basic Java, there will be many interactable 
                elements within each page. This will include doing some stuff with add/subtracting/multiplying
                /dividing functions in JS. I also plan on doing JS work with the conditionals page 
                by writing a "function" within the oage that will allow the user to type some data 
                and submit it. Resulting in JS being able to take the data and do some work on it.
                I will also include many photos to help explain some of the concepts and show what they
                look like within an actual program. I have seen many examples of these types of thing
                on sites such as W3schools and many others.
