                <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
                <h3><a href = "https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
                <p>This is Apples main site where they have all of their products on display.
                    The top navigation bar lists all of the categories for products they might have. 
                    As you scroll down o the page, there are many boxes that are advertising different products
                    and offers they have.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast- There are two main colors on this page, white and black. These two contrast
                        very well and make for a website thats easy to look at.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repitition- As you scroll down the page you are met with several elements that take after one another.
                        As well as when you navigate to another page, it has the same look and feel as the other pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment- The alignment on this page is very well done as all of the elements are very well 
                        organized up and down the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity- Apple really has multiple categories of things on its home page but it does do a 
                        good job of putting things together that belong together. For example they have two elements as the 
                        top about the Iphone, then as you scroll down it becomes more Apple Watch based.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3><a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
                <p>This page is for people to learn more about and apply to the Yale School of Art. It has a small menu in the
                    top left corner where it can take yiou to diferent pages of the site. On each page there is a diiferent background
                    and sometimes different colors.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast- The colors on this page are all over the place and none of them really match each other.
                        As well as the background art is very distracting and unsettling top the eyes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repitition- Each page of this site is slightly different with an entirely different background each time
                        and sometimes different colors around the blocks of text, so not very good repitition.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment- The alignment seems to be a little off on each page, as the blocks surrounding teh text
                        can kind of just get muddled around with no super consistent design.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity- Everything of relevance is pretty tightly gathered together on each page 
                        so not terrible on this front but could still use some work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
