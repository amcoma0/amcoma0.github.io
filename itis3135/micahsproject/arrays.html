            <h2>Arrays</h2>
            <p>There is another data type that was not covered in the Variables page, and that is an array. 
                Arrays are used to essentially hold a list of other data types. 
                For example, let’s say you need to store the first names of 10 employees. 
                What you might think of doing is declaring 10 separate String variables 
                and assigning one of the names to each of them. 
                However, arrays make that much simpler. You can declare arrays as follows:
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>variableType[X] arrayName;</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In this statement, “X” would be replaced with the length of the array. 
                An array’s length determines how many items it can store inside of it. 
                So, to create an array called “employeeNames” to store 10 names, 
                we would use the above statement followed by a comma separated list of each item 
                we want to put inside the array, surrounded by curly braces: 
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>String[10] employeeNames = {"Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Michael", "Kevin", "Andy", "Phyllis", "Stanley", "Oscar", "Angela"};</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In order to actually access the values within an array, 
                we use the array name immediately followed by the index of our desired value in square brackets. 
                Now, one very important thing to remember about arrays in programming is that the index of an array 
                does NOT start at 1, but at 0. What does this mean? Well, in the code below, 
                try and take a guess as to what value the String variable “myName” will be assigned.
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>String myName = employeeNames[1];</p>
            </div>
            <button onclick = "jim_button()">Jim</button>
            <button onclick = "dwight_button()">Dwight</button>
            <p id = "display-answer"></p>
            <p>
                You can even use variables to specify array indexes. 
                Interact with the code below to see how it affects the output, 
                assuming the “employeeNames” array is the same as declared above.
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>int index = <select name = "arrays-example" id = "arrays-example">
                    <option value = "0">0</option>
                    <option value = "1">1</option>
                    <option value = "2">2</option>
                    <option value = "3">3</option>
                    <option value = "4">4</option>
                    <option value = "5">5</option>
                    <option value = "6">6</option>
                    <option value = "7">7</option>
                    <option value = "8">8</option>
                    <option value = "9">9</option>
                </select>;</p>
                <p>System.out.println(employeeNames[index] + "will be given a raise!");</p>
                <button onclick = "user_array()">Run</button>
            </div>
            <p id = "print-text"></p>
