            <p>
                Up until now, boolean values haven’t really seemed to have any important use. 
                However, when combined with the power of conditionals, that changes.
            </p>
            <h2>If Statements</h2>
            <p>
                In Java, if statements can be used to decide whether or not to execute a portion of code. 
                The syntax for if statements is as follows:
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>if(conditonal)</p>
                <p>{</p>
                    <p>&emsp; (code to be executed)</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Let’s take a very simple example. Say you want to divide two int variables, “a” and “b”. 
                However, if the second of the int variables is a 0, division will be impossible. 
                We can use if statements to check to see if that variable is, in fact, 0.
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>if (b > 0)</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println(“Result: ” + a / b);</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>If “a” was assigned a value of 8, and “b” was assigned a value of 4, the output would be:</p>
            <div class = "output">
                <p>Result: 4</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                However, if “b” was 0, no matter what “a” was, nothing would be printed. 
                This might be a bit confusing for anyone using our program to try and divide numbers. 
                We can clear up that confusion by using an else statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Else statements can be attached to the end of if statements, and will run if the corresponding 
                if statement returns false. 
                In our example, we could print an error message to the console with an else statement like this:
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>if (b > 0)</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println(“Result: ” + a / b);</p>
                <p>}</p>
                <p>else</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println(“Error! You can’t divide by zero!”);</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Let’s take another example. Say we need to figure out whether an integer “a” is between 1 and 10. 
                We could put an if statement inside another, with the first one checking to see if the integer is greater than 1,
                and the second checking to see if the integer is less than 10 (or vice versa). 
                This solution would look something like this:
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>if (a > 1)</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; if (a < 10)</p>
                <p>&emsp; {</p>
                <p>&emsp; &emsp; System.out.println("a is between 1 and 10");</p>
                <p>&emsp; }</p>
                <p>}</p>
                <p>else</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println("a is not between 1 and 10");</p>
                <p>}</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                There is, however, a more efficient method to do this. We can optimize this code by using logical operators. 
                Logical operators can be used to extract a single boolean value (which if you remember, means either true or false) 
                from multiple comparison statements.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Operator</th>
                    <th>Syntax</th>
                    <th>Result if a = false & b = false</th>
                    <th>Result if a = true & b = false</th>
                    <th>Result if a = true & b = true</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>AND</td>
                    <td>a && b</td>
                    <td>false</td>
                    <td>false</td>
                    <td>true</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>OR</td>
                    <td>a || b</td>
                    <td>false</td>
                    <td>true</td>
                    <td>true</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>NOT</td>
                    <td>!(a && b)</td>
                    <td>true</td>
                    <td>true</td>
                    <td>false</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                We can combine these logical operators with the comparison 
                operators to make this code more efficient:
            </p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>if (a > 1 && a < 10)</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println("a is between 1 and 10");</p>
                <p>}</p>
                <p>else</p>
                <p>{</p>
                <p>&emsp; System.out.println("a is not between 1 and 10");</p>
                <p>}</p>
