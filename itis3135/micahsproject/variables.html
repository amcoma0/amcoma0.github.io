            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>
                In all programming languages, “variables” are containers that are used to store data for a program. 
                A variable could be used to store how many of a particular item is in stock on an online store. 
                Variables can also be used to store the name of that item, or how much that item costs. 
                There are five main types of variables in Java:

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Variable Type</th>
                    <th>What is it?</th>
                    <th>Examples</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>int</td>
                    <td>
                        The int variable type is used to store integers. 
                        An int can be any whole number, whether positive or negative.
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        4

                <tr>
                    <td>float</td>
                    <td>The float variable type stores floating point numbers (aka decimal numbers).</td>
                    <td>
                        3.1415
                        7.00
                        364.892

                    <td>char</td>
                    <td>
                        The char type stores a single character. 
                        It can be a letter, a number, or any other symbol.

                <tr>
                    <td>string</td>
                    <td>
                        The String variable types hold text (or a “string” of characters). 
                        It can be used to store words or sentences
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        “Hello World!”
                        “How are you?”
                        “Items left: 75”
                        “John Doe”
                        “Green”
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>boolean</td>
                    <td>The boolean variable type can only hold two values: true or false.</td>
                    <td>
                        true
                        false

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>The most common way to make, or instantiate, a variable in Java is as follows:</p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>variableType variableName = value;</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the above code, “variableType” should be the type of variable we want (int, String, etc.). 
                Next, “variableName” is whatever we want the name of the variable to be. 
                This is what we’ll use in the future to refer to whatever data is stored in that variable. 
                Finally, “value” is what is actually held by the variable; the data itself.
            </p>
            <p>Here are a few examples of declaring actual variables in Java:</p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>String greeting = “Hello there!”;</p>
                <p>int livesLeft = 5;</p>
                <p>boolean isGameOver = true;</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "note">
                <p>
                    Note! The end of a line of code in Java is virtually always indicated by a semicolon (;), 
                    don’t forget that!
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>You can even use variables to declare other variables.</p>
            <div class = "code-block">
                <p>int myApples = 3;</p>
                <p>int yourApples = 7;</p>
                <p>int totalApples = myApples + yourApples;</p>
            </div>
        </main>
