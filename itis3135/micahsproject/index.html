                Welcome to Decaf!  This website is intended to teach anyone interested in 
                learning the Java programming language at a basic level, and includes a general overview of some of the broader topics 
                relevant to the language. This site has a page each for the following concepts:
            </p>
            <h4><a href = "variables.html" class = "inhome-nav">Variables</a></h4>
            <h4><a href = "conditionals.html">Conditionals</a></h4>
            <h4><a href = "loops.html">Loops</a></h4>
            <h4><a href = "functions.html">Functions</a></h4>
            <p>
                Our hope is that by the time you’ve finished reading through this site, 
                you’ll have a general understanding of how the Java programming language works, 
                and maybe even be able to write a few basic programs of your own!
